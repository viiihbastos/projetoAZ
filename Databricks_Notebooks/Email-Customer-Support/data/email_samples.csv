I work for the Company Name on the M20-12 Scheme. Because of our constructions work, we need to modify 
the power supplies in the area. However, we have concerns around one supply which is already at full capacity. 
We could potentially need additional supplies, apart from the existing one. 

Please find attached the problematic location. 

postcode Y72 O90 - Location Link 
[https://url.location.com/v2/url?u=https-446A__www.google.com_maps_place_Arts94u2u492u=] 

Could we keep the original supply and add another 10kva to the existing transformer?
