# MAGIC ###Importance of Evaluating Individual Tools
# MAGIC An Agentic application is built using multiple components (tools in our case) that work together. The quality of the response from Agent is highly dependent on how the individual components (tools) perform. There are multiple parameters that affects the performance of each of these tools like the model being used, temperature, max_tokens etc. that need to be tweaked individually for each tools to get best quality in the response.

# MAGIC ### Lets evaluate all the tools we built to select appropriate parameters
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE:** For the sake of simplicity, we are performing full evaluation only on few tools. But we can extend the same concept to all the tools being used.

# MAGIC ####Test Member Id Retriever
# MAGIC Since this is a very simple tool that uses a small model endpoint with a straight forward goal, we will not be doing a full evaluation. We will just run some unit tests.

# MAGIC ####Test and Evaluate QuestionClassifier
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `QuestionClassifier` is implemented using a simple Zero Shot prompt on an LLM. 
# MAGIC We will create an evaluation dataframe with `input_text` and `expected_response` and use MLflow Evaluate to asses how the response matches to the expected response. This can be achieved using the `exact_match/v1` metric available in the open-source MLflow LLM evaluation functionality. [Read More](https://docs.databricks.com/en/mlflow/llm-evaluate.html)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will evaluate the model against two different model endpoints.
