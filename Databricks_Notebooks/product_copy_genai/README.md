## Introduction

With this solution accelerator, we will show how generative AI can be used to help organizations efficiently generate product descriptions, *i.e.* product copy, for use on an ecommerce site.  The overarching workflow supported across these notebooks can be visualized as follows:

The first step will be to extract a basic description of a product from an image.  This basic description as well as metadata provided by the item supplier will then be used to generate a robust product description using a high-powered LLM.  This work will be performed in three separate notebooks focused on:

1. Data Preparation (02_Data_Prep)
2. Image Description Extraction (03_Extract_Image_Descriptions)
3. Description Generation (04_Generate_Product_Descriptions)
