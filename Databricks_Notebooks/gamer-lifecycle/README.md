The series of assets inside this repo show a few of the capabilities possible when leveraging databricks as the analytics platform of choice in your studio. Like any good game there are choices and the assets here let you explore a variety of real world solutions.


Included are currently three solutions that each leverage Machine Learning, Data Engineering and BI. You can expect to see best practices on leveraging databricks products such as Delta, Delta Live Tables, MLFlow, and DB SQL to solve these challenges.
1. Tackling Toxicity with In-Game text
2. Understanding Player Churn Risk & Lifetime Value
3. Leveraging In-Game Match Telemetry to make data driven design & balancing choices

## Walkthrough

To run this accelerator, clone this repo into a Databricks workspace. Attach the `RUNME` notebook to any cluster running a DBR 11.0 or later runtime, and execute the notebook via Run-All. A multi-step-job describing the accelerator pipeline will be created, and the link will be provided. Execute the multi-step-job to see how the pipeline runs. The job configuration is written in the RUNME notebook in json format. The cost associated with running the accelerator is the user's responsibility.
