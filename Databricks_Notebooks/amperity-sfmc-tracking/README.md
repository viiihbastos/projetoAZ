## Use Case
In this notebook, we will process daily extracts of tracking data originating from email-based customer marketing campaigns orchestrated through the Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC).  Data from these campaigns are very useful for managing future marketing engagement efforts, making them a valuable input to customer data platform (CDP) systems through which these efforts are managed.

The challenge with these data are that they are organized around the scheduled unit of work executed in the SFMC system and not necessarily the customer to whom the email messages are being sent.  The data can be quite voluminous, depending on how jobs are configured, so that organizations will typically want to  restructure and aggregate information from the larger email tracking dataset to align it with the needs of CDP and the marketers that use it.

## Scope
We will demonstrate how SFMC email tracking extracts can be processed within the Databricks lakehouse, making the complete set available for detailed process analysis, and then condensed for consumption by a CDP.  We will make use of Amperity's [Databricks data source](https://docs.amperity.com/datagrid/source_databricks.html) capability to demonstrate how these data can be integrated into a CDP.

## Getting started

Although specific solutions can be downloaded as .dbc archives from our websites, we recommend cloning these repositories onto your databricks environment. Not only will you get access to latest code, but you will be part of a community of experts driving industry best practices and re-usable solutions, influencing our respective industries.

To start using a solution accelerator in Databricks simply follow these steps: 

1. Clone solution accelerator repository in Databricks using [Databricks Repos](https://www.databricks.com/product/repos)
2. Attach the `RUNME` notebook to any cluster and execute the notebook via Run-All. A multi-step-job describing the accelerator pipeline will be created, and the link will be provided. The job configuration is written in the RUNME notebook in json format. 
3. Execute the multi-step-job to see how the pipeline runs. 
4. You might want to modify the samples in the solution accelerator to your need, collaborate with other users and run the code samples against your own data. To do so start by changing the Git remote of your repository  to your organization’s repository vs using our samples repository (learn more). You can now commit and push code, collaborate with other user’s via Git and follow your organization’s processes for code development.

The cost associated with running the accelerator is the user's responsibility.
