# Smolder: A package for ingesting HL7 messages to Delta Lake

Note: Please reference the library, code, and usage at https://github.com/databrickslabs/smolder. This is no longer maintained. 

In this notebook, we demonstrate how [Smolder](https://github.com/databrickslabs/smolder) can be used to parse HL7v2 message into your lakehouse. Smolder defines a very simple Spark file format that loads one HL7 message per file, and parses it into a dataframe. Here, we'll demonstrate this using a stream of HL7 ADT messages generated from a simulated dataset with [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea)

To run this accelerator, clone this repo into a Databricks workspace. Attach the RUNME notebook to any cluster running a DBR 11.0 or later runtime, and execute the notebook via Run-All. A multi-step-job describing the accelerator pipeline will be created, and the link will be provided. Execute the multi-step-job to see how the pipeline runs.

The job configuration is written in the RUNME notebook in json format. The cost associated with running the accelerator is the user's responsibility.
