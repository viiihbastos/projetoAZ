# MAGIC # Custom Spark Streaming Source - Payer MRF
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Use Case 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC CMS Schemas for MRF are built using a single json object which spark by default cannot split. Reading these large files often results in Out of Memory errors. This parser serves to transform any array objects under the header into multiple splittable lists that can be parsed. See sample schemas here ->  https://github.com/CMSgov/price-transparency-guide/tree/master/schemas
