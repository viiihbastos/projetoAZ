-- MAGIC # Build summary tables using Delta Live Tables
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC * Summary tables are lossy, aggregated IOC occurrence information (essentially a materialized view) constructed to speed up ad hoc historical IOC matching.
-- MAGIC * You will need to modify the database/schema name in order for the SQL to work
-- MAGIC * When you create the DLT pipeline (see [Quickstart](https://docs.databricks.com/data-engineering/delta-live-tables/delta-live-tables-quickstart.html)), you should also specify the target database/schema to ioc_matching_{your sql compatible username}
