*By analyzing news articles and social media sentiment, portfolio managers can gauge market sentiment. Studies have found that Financial news predicts stock market volatility better than close price, hence moving from descriptive to predictive approach to risk management. Similarly, new source of information around Environmental, Social and Governance may bring signal correlated with market volatility, extending risk management to systemic risk (climate change, flood risk). Positive or negative news surrounding a particular stock or sector can influence investment decisions. News articles often contain information about company earnings, product launches, management changes, or regulatory issues. Portfolio managers use this information to assess the fundamental health and growth potential of companies, which helps them make buy or sell decisions. They evaluate factors such as volatility, beta, and correlation to ensure that the portfolio is diversified and aligned with the investor's risk tolerance and investment objectives.*
