Our goal over these notebooks is to examine how two core Survival Analysis techniques can be applied to better understand patterns around customer attrition in a subscription model.  In this notebook, we will prepare a publicly available dataset for analysis.  This data will then serve as the basis for some exploratory analysis and modeling intended to assist us in understanding and predicting customer churn.
