# MAGIC %md ### README - MLflow Export/Import
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Overview
# MAGIC * Export and import MLflow objects - runs, experiments or registered models.
# MAGIC * Copy MLflow objects from one workspace (tracking server) to another.
# MAGIC * Customers often need to copy MLflow objects (registered models, experiments or runs) to another workspace.
# MAGIC   * For example, we train model runs in the dev workspace, and then we wish to promote the best run to a production workspace.
# MAGIC   * There is no official and easy way to do this.
# MAGIC   * Customer experiment data is currently locked into a workspace and not portable.
# MAGIC * These notebooks invoke the [mlflow-export-import](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow-export-import) package to address these problems.
# MAGIC * You will need to set up a shared cloud bucket mounted on DBFS in your source and destination workspaces.
# MAGIC * For details see:

# MAGIC #### Setup
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The [Common]($./Common) notebook installs the mlflow-export-import package from github.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC pip install mlflow-export-import
# MAGIC ```
